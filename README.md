## Tornado Game

This is a simple game I made for my seven-year-old kid.

### Objective

Move the truck to try to avoid the tornado. If you occupy the same square as the tornado, you'll lose.

### Gameplay

You can use <code>w</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>s</code>, <code>d</code> or Arrow keys to move the player. The tornado moves on its own.

## Roadmap

We plan to add:

- Variable difficulty (multiple tornadoes, faster tornadoes)
- User selection of grid size
- Scoring (getting close to the tornado without dying will give you points)
